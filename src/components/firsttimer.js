        <h2>Learning to Snowplough</h2>
          <p>Find a small incline to learn how to snowplough. Explain the snowplough, or wedge, shape and how it can control speed.
            Practice this until the student feels in control of their stopping. The game red light green light can be very useful for developing control.

        <h2>Learning to Turn</h2>
          <p>Now that your student is comfortable stopping, they are ready to learn how to turn.

          Gradually apply pressure into the inside edge of the left ski to start to turn the skis to the right
            The exercises Airplane can help students to make a turn.
